"""issue_digest.py — Priority- and dependency-annotated digest of open GitHub issues.

Fetches open issues (and open PRs, to detect work already in flight) via the
`gh` CLI and prints a token-lean digest. Raw `gh --json` output never has to
enter a context window.

Beyond the mechanical readiness flags (BLOCKED-BY / HAS-OPEN-PR /
NOT-READY-LABEL) it computes three things the ordering decision needs:

  * reverse dependency edges — how many *other* open issues this one unblocks,
    which is the single strongest "do this first" signal;
  * a heuristic priority score built from unblock count, priority labels,
    leverage keywords (CI, schema, interface, security, breakage…), milestone,
    and staleness;
  * a priority *tier* — the `priority: P0`…`P3` label if the issue already
    carries one (or a recognized equivalent), otherwise a suggested tier derived
    from the score, printed as `~P1`.

**The label is the persisted ranking.** A labeled backlog is ranked by reading
labels alone — no issue prose has to be re-analyzed on every run. Suggested
tiers exist to be written back by `apply_priority_labels.py`, after which they
become confirmed ones. The score survives as the within-tier tie-breaker and as
the input to those suggestions; it is a *ranking hint*, not a verdict, and is
computed from raw issue bodies even when `--body-chars 0` keeps that prose out
of the caller's context. Confirm suggested tiers against
references/priority-rubric.md before acting on them.

An issue can also state these facts outright instead of leaving them to be
inferred, in a `<!-- ship: ... -->` block (see parse_ship_contract): the tier,
what it waits on, what it blocks, and which paths it touches. A declared tier
is settled, not suggested; declared paths are what make the parallel-grouping
decision a set intersection rather than a guess.

Usage:
    issue_digest.py [--label L]... [--assignee A] [--milestone M]
                    [--issue N]... [--limit N] [--body-chars N]
                    [--rank-only] [--select N] [--with-rank]
                    [--detail N]... [--detail-top K] [--no-rank]
                    [--audit] [--cache-ttl S] [--refresh] [--json]

Output (default: markdown). `--json` emits the same data as a JSON object for
programmatic consumers.

`--select` composes: `--with-rank` appends the ranking table and
`--detail`/`--detail-top` append issue bodies, so a run's whole startup question
is one call. `--issue` narrows what is ranked; `--detail` does not.

The `gh` fetch can be cached under the repo's run-state directory, keyed on the
arguments that change what `gh` returns — but `--cache-ttl` defaults to 0, so it
is off unless a caller asks for it. `plan.py` asks for 300 seconds because a
startup's calls are seconds apart; anything reading the backlog after this run
has changed it should not. That is the safe default: a stale digest can re-select
an issue this run already merged, and nothing downstream would notice.

Exit codes:
    0 = digest printed (may contain zero issues)
    1 = gh invocation failed

#     carry one needs no research pass even before the labels are written.

#     which issues might collide into a set intersection.
