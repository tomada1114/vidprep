"""plan.py — The whole startup of a shipping-issues run, in one call.

Steps 0 through 2c of SKILL.md used to cost eight or more tool calls before a
line of code was written: preflight, a `--select`, a `--rank-only`, two or three
`--issue` passes to read the top issues, an ad-hoc probe for the repo's hook
manager, and a judgement call about which issues can share a batch. Every one of
those either re-fetched data another had already fetched, or re-measured a fact
that is constant for the repository.

This script answers all of it once and prints a single block: where the repo
stands, what the backlog ranks to, which issues can be worked in parallel, and
the exact next command. It makes exactly one `gh` fetch pair (and none at all on
a warm digest cache), and it never puts issue prose in the caller's context —
`issue_digest.py --detail-top` is the separate, deliberate call for that.

What it does NOT do is decide anything it cannot decide mechanically. The
grouping line says which of three states it is in — MECHANICAL, PARTIAL or
SERIAL — and PARTIAL means some candidate issue declares no `touches=`, so the
proposed batch is a starting point for the caller's own judgement rather than an
answer. That degrades in the right direction: the more issues carry a ship
contract, the less there is left to judge.

Usage:
    plan.py [--mode all|single|<issue number>] [--max-parallel N]
            [--label L]... [--assignee A] [--milestone M]
            [--include-design] [--refresh] [--record] [--json]

Exit codes:
    0 = a plan was printed (it may say SERIAL, or say there is nothing to ship)
    1 = preflight is BLOCKED, or the digest could not be read
    2 = usage error
